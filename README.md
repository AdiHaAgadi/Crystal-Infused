Crystal Infused is a fabric mod that adds 8 new crystal ores to the game.

These crystals will allow you to enhance your enchanted books a level beyond the vanilla maximum - in a way that does not feel overpowered in the slightest!
<br/><br/>
There are plans to expand on the core mechanic and even add new features in the future, as well as to update to the latest versions!
